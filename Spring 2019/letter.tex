\noindent Dear Reader,
\bigbreak

After many delays and a long hiatus, the seventh edition of \textit{Meditations} has arrived on the (virtual) bookshelves of our beloved audience. The journal has a duty to deliver its contributors' work in an orderly and timely fashion, and in both regards we have failed this year, albeit due to unforeseen circumstances. But, in the spirit of effective altruism, we ought not dwell on the good we could have done before or the good we could do in the future, but rather the good we can do now, and so in that spirit I give you the long overdue publication of three excellent essays in philosophy.

The journal furnishes a cornerstone of the Undergraduate Philosophy Club at UCLA, and it is here where students of philosophy, not just those from the journal's home in Los Angeles but across the globe, are rewarded for their work. This year's journal covers a diverse selection of topics: promise theory, epistemology and political theory. I hope that at least one of these works will peak your interest, and perhaps even inspire you to submit your own work for a future issue. Only time will tell; for now, do enjoy the latest issue of these \emph{Meditations}.
